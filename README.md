# launchpad-for-life

**Concept**

1.  **Google Calendar Integration:** Your app would need to securely connect to your Google Calendar using an API to fetch your daily schedule.
2.  **Event Display:** The Launchpad's grid could display a simplified overview of your events for the day, potentially using different colors to represent various event types.
3.  **Current Event Timer:** A designated row or column could act as a countdown timer, with the number of lit pads visually indicating the time remaining in your current calendar event.
4.  **Pomodoro Timer:** A separate section of the Launchpad could be dedicated to a Pomodoro timer. You could configure the work and break durations, and the Launchpad would indicate the current state (work/break) and time remaining.
5.  **Controls:** Some pads could be assigned to actions like switching between the calendar view, timer view, or adjusting the Pomodoro settings.

**Development Steps**

1.  **Hardware:** You'll need a Launchpad Mini MK3.
2.  **Software:**
    *   **Programming Language:** You could use Python, which has libraries for communicating with the Launchpad and interacting with APIs.
    *   **Google Calendar API:** You'll need to set up a project in the Google Cloud Console to obtain credentials for accessing your calendar data.
    *   **Launchpad Library:** A Python library like `python-launchpad` can help you control the Launchpad's lights and buttons.
3.  **Coding:**
    *   **Fetch Calendar Events:** Write code to authenticate with the Google Calendar API and retrieve your events for the day.
    *   **Visualize Events:** Map your events to the Launchpad's grid, considering how to represent different events, times, and durations.
    *   **Timers:** Create functions to manage the current event timer and the Pomodoro timer, updating the Launchpad's display accordingly.
    *   **Controls:** Assign button presses to actions like switching views or adjusting timer settings.

**Challenges and Considerations**

*   **Limited Display:** The Launchpad Mini MK3 has a small grid, so you'll need to prioritize which information to display and how to represent it concisely.
*   **API Limits:** Google Calendar API has usage limits, so you'll want to optimize your code to avoid unnecessary requests.
*   **Custom App:** This would be a custom project, so you might not find a readily available app with these exact features.
